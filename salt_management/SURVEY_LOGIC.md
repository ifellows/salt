# Survey Logic — Skip, Validation, Skip-To, and Eligibility

A guide for survey authors. SALT lets you control four things with short
written conditions:

- **Skip a question** — hide it for some participants.
- **Check an answer** — reject an answer that doesn't make sense.
- **Skip ahead** — jump past a block of questions.
- **Decide eligibility** — let only the intended participants take the survey.

You write these conditions in the survey editor — for example, `age >= 18`.
You don't need to be a programmer, but you do need to follow the rules in this
guide carefully: a wrong condition quietly changes who sees what.

The conditions are written in a small, widely-used expression language called
**JEXL**. This guide covers everything you need; the full language reference
is at
<https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/reference/syntax.html>.

## Where you write logic

Open a question in the survey editor (the **question edit modal**). Near the
bottom are three logic fields:

| Field in the question edit modal | What it does |
|----------------------------------|--------------|
| **Skip Logic** | Hides this question when the condition is true. |
| **Skip-To Expression** + **Skip-To Target** | After this question is answered, jumps to another question. |
| **Validation Script** | Decides whether the answer just entered is accepted. |

Eligibility is set once for the whole survey, in the **Eligibility Settings**
card of the editor:

| Field | What it does |
|-------|--------------|
| **Eligibility Script** | After the eligibility questions, decides whether the participant may continue. |

Leave any of these blank and it does nothing — the question always shows,
every answer is accepted, no jump.

## Referring to a question's answer

Every question has a **Short Name** — a field in the question edit modal, a
short label such as `age` or `tsres`. In a condition, you refer to a
participant's answer by typing that Short Name.

Short Names are **case-sensitive** — type them exactly as they were set.

---

## What an answer looks like

When you name a question in a condition, you get the participant's answer to
that question:

- **Multiple choice** — you get the **number of the option they chose**.
  Options are numbered **starting at 0**: the first option in the list is `0`,
  the second is `1`, the third is `2`, and so on. So `sex == 1` means "the
  participant chose the **second** option of the question named `sex`."
- **Numeric** — the number they entered.
- **Text** — the text they typed.
- **Multi-select** — the set of options they ticked (each option still
  numbered from 0). See [Multi-select questions](#multi-select-questions).
- **A question with no answer** — one that was skipped, or one that comes
  later in the survey — counts as *nothing*. A comparison against it is simply
  false.

> **Options are numbered from 0, not 1 — this is the most common mistake.**
> The first option is `0`. If a question lists *Yes* then *No*, then *Yes* is
> `0` and *No* is `1`. If you are unsure what number an option has, use the
> [logic tester](#testing-your-logic) — it shows you.

## Writing conditions

A condition compares values and produces a yes/no (true/false) result.

| To do this | Use |
|------------|-----|
| Is equal to / is not equal to | `==`  `!=` |
| Less than / greater than | `<`  `<=`  `>`  `>=` |
| **Both** parts must be true | `&&` |
| **Either** part may be true | `\|\|` |
| Not / the opposite of | `!` |
| Group parts together | `( … )` |

Examples:

- `age >= 18` — the answer to `age` is 18 or more.
- `sex == 1 && age >= 18` — `sex` is the second option **and** `age` is at least 18.
- `result == 0 || result == 2` — `result` is the first **or** the third option.

Text values must be in quotes: `nationality == 'Ugandan'`.

## Skip Logic — hiding a question

The **Skip Logic** field hides the question when its condition is **true**.

> Skip Logic is a *skip-when* rule. Write the condition under which the
> question should **not** appear — not the condition under which it should.

Examples from the CRANE MSM survey:

- On the question `elmssxt` (last anal sex), Skip Logic `eltgsx != 0`.
  `eltgsx` ("ever had sex") has *Yes* as its first option (`0`), so this hides
  `elmssxt` whenever the participant did **not** answer *Yes*.
- On `condno` ("why no condom"), Skip Logic `cond != 1`. `cond` has *No* as
  its second option (`1`), so `condno` is asked only after a *No*.

---

## Validation Script — checking an answer

The **Validation Script** runs after the participant enters an answer. If the
condition is **true**, the answer is accepted. If it is false, the answer is
rejected and the participant must correct it before continuing.

Inside a Validation Script, the answer being checked is called **`value`**:

- On a numeric age question: `value >= 15 && value <= 89`
- On a "how many people" question whose answer cannot exceed an earlier count:
  `value >= 0 && value <= dgbehav`

`value` is a reserved word — the editor will not let you give a question the
Short Name `value`.

> Take extra care with Validation Scripts: a mistake in one rejects **every**
> answer, leaving the participant unable to continue. Always
> [test it](#testing-your-logic).

---

## Skip-To — jumping ahead

Skip-To leaps over a run of questions in one step. It uses two fields in the
question edit modal:

- **Skip-To Expression** — a condition.
- **Skip-To Target** — the **Short Name** of the question to jump to.

After the question is answered (and passes its Validation Script), if the
Skip-To Expression is **true**, the survey jumps straight to the Skip-To
Target and everything in between is passed over. If false, the survey
continues normally.

The answer just given is available as **`value`** here too.

Example: on `tsevno` — asked only of people who have never tested for HIV — the
Skip-To Expression jumps the participant ahead to the PrEP block (Skip-To
Target `prmss`), past the HIV-treatment questions for people who have tested.

**Skip Logic vs Skip-To:** use **Skip Logic** to drop a single question; use
**Skip-To** to leap over a whole block at once.

---

## Eligibility Script

The **Eligibility Script**, in the Eligibility Settings card, runs once after
the eligibility questions. If it is **true**, the participant is eligible and
continues; if false, they are shown the ineligibility message and the survey
ends.

It can use the Short Name of any eligibility question. The CRANE MSM survey
uses:

```
tutsex == 1 && tutage >= 18 && eltgsx == 0 && elmssxt == 0
  && (elcoup == 0 || elcoup == 1)
```

— the second option for `tutsex` (male), at least 18, *Yes* to having had sex,
and so on.

The ineligibility message itself is edited on the **System Messages** tab, as
the "Ineligibility Message".

---

## Multi-select questions

A multi-select answer is the **set of options the participant ticked**. To test
whether a particular option was ticked, use `=~`, which means "is among":

- `2 =~ q` — option number 2 (the third option) was ticked.
- `2 =~ q || 4 =~ q` — option 2 **or** option 4 was ticked.
- `2 =~ q && 4 =~ q` — option 2 **and** option 4 were both ticked.

The question edit modal also has **Minimum Selections** and **Maximum
Selections** fields to limit how many options may be ticked.

---

## Common mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Counting options from 1 | The first option is `0`, the second is `1`. |
| Treating Skip Logic as "show when" | It **hides** the question when true — write the skip-*when* condition. |
| A typo in a Short Name, or wrong upper/lower case | Type Short Names exactly as set. |
| Forgetting quotes around text | `nationality == 'Ugandan'`, not `nationality == Ugandan`. |
| A broken Validation Script | It rejects every answer — test it before publishing. |

## Testing your logic

The tablet has a built-in **logic tester** that shows every condition as the
survey runs.

**To turn it on:** on the tablet, log in as an administrator, open
**Developer Settings**, and switch on **Debug Conditional Statements**.

With it on, each time the survey reaches a Skip Logic, Validation Script,
Skip-To, or Eligibility condition, a window appears showing:

- **Context** — a table of every question's Short Name and the participant's
  current answer. This is the surest way to see what number an option produced.
- **Statement** — the condition itself. You can edit it here to try variations
  and see the result change; edits made here are for testing only and are
  **not saved**.
- **Result** — what the condition currently works out to, or an error message
  if the condition is written incorrectly.

Tap **Continue** to let the survey proceed.

Turn **Debug Conditional Statements** back **off** before real data collection
— otherwise staff are interrupted by this window at every condition.
