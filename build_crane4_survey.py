Generate a SALT survey import bundle (schema_version 1) from the
CRANE 4 SURVEY - Short MSM Word document (Version Date 11 Nov 2025).

See salt_management/SURVEY_IMPORT_EXPORT.md for the bundle contract.

Conventions applied here:
  - JEXL multiple_choice answers are 0-based OPTION INDICES (verified in
    SurveyViewModel.buildJexlContext / Answer.getValue). option_value is set
    to the docx code purely for analysis exports.
  - pre_script is SKIP-IF: true => question hidden.
  - Computed/hidden docx fields (TUTDOB, ALCSCR1/2, PHQSUM/SCRE, BMHIV, TSTAT)
    are dropped; SALT has no computed question type.
  - Biomarkers: 4 rapid tests in test_configurations; CD4 & viral load are
    deployment-global lab tests, configured separately (not in the bundle).
